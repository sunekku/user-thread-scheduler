# user-thread-scheduler

Primitive preemptive user-level thread framework that enables thread creation and deletion. 
Other utilities allow sychronization (condition variables) and mutual exclusion (mutex locks).
For Linux systems. Main thread must use **thread_init()** to initialize system. Other threads begin
execution from within a stub function and call **thread_exit()** from within as well. File containing main() should be entitled **main.c**, 
and corresponding header should be entitled **main.h** for *make* to produce a *main* executable. Enter *make clean* to remove intermediary
files generated by the *make* command.

Occasionally drew inspiration from existing frameworks for this one, but it was such a headache to figure out
that I might as well take all the credit. Nobody does anything new from scratch unless they're being
paid.
